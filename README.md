# App

## Context
This repo contains the source code of our UWind application. It basically consists in a platform, developed for the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, on which students, monitors and administrators can manage the registration and progress of students in sailboard activities.
It aims to facilitate the access to information for both students and monitors.

## Collaborators
This application is developed by 5 students in their last year of engineering school Polytech Grenoble for the needs of a school project.
- Rim El Jraidi
- Killian Pareilleux
- Gloria Nguena Zemao
- Nhat Quang Ho

## Application
The application body has been generated thanks to Jhipster. CI with Travis and Sonar has been set up, and the app is deployed on an Azure VM.
You can find more details about the app itself in the README of the uwind directory.
The scripts directory contains scripts that help to set up the required environment to execute the app on Azure VM.
The jdl directory contains the jdh file (representing an UML entity graph) used to generate the app in Jhipster.
More documentation can be found in the Docs repo.
